# src/world/ — WorldWeaver API Client

## Purpose

Async HTTP client for the WorldWeaver server. Handles all communication
between a resident and the shared world. The WorldWeaver server is the
canonical source of truth — this client is read/write but never authoritative.

## Endpoints Used

### Scene (Fast + Slow loops)

```
GET /api/world/scene/{session_id}
```
Returns: current location, colocated characters (with activity summaries and
vibes), recent local events. This is the fast loop's entire context.

### Action (Fast + Slow loops)

```
POST /api/action
{
    "session_id": "...",
    "action": "I lean against the wall and listen to the pipes."
}
```
Returns: narrative text, choices, updated vars. The reducer validates and
commits the action to the world fact graph.

### Next (Slow loop — choice selection)

```
POST /api/next
{
    "session_id": "...",
    "vars": { "visited_cafe": true }
}
```
Returns: next scene narrative, new choices, updated vars.

### Letters (Mail loop only)

```
POST /api/world/letter
{
    "from_name": "nadia",
    "to_agent": "margot",
    "body": "...",
    "session_id": "..."
}

POST /api/world/letter/reply
{
    "from_agent": "nadia",
    "to_session_id": "...",
    "body": "..."
}
```

### Scene Events (Fast loop trigger — future)

```
GET /api/world/scene/{session_id}/new-events?since={timestamp}
```
Returns events at the agent's location since the given timestamp. Used by
the fast loop to determine whether to fire or skip. When WorldWeaver adds
SSE/webhook support, this polling endpoint becomes unnecessary.

### Session Bootstrap (Resident initialization)

```
POST /api/session/bootstrap
{
    "session_id": "...",
    "world_id": "...",
    "world_theme": "...",
    "player_role": "...",
    "tone": "...",
    "storylet_count": 8,
    "bootstrap_source": "worldweaver-agent"
}
```

### Health

```
GET /health
```
Returns `{"ok": true}` if server is up. Used during startup to wait for server.

## Interface Contract

```python
class WorldWeaverClient:
    async def health(self) -> bool
    async def wait_for_ready(self, timeout_seconds: float = 120.0) -> None
    async def bootstrap_session(self, session_id: str, world_id: str, role: str, ...) -> dict
    async def get_scene(self, session_id: str) -> SceneData
    async def post_action(self, session_id: str, action: str) -> TurnResult
    async def post_next(self, session_id: str, vars: dict) -> TurnResult
    async def get_new_events(self, session_id: str, since: str) -> list[Event]
    async def send_letter(self, from_name: str, to_agent: str, body: str, session_id: str) -> dict
    async def reply_letter(self, from_agent: str, to_session_id: str, body: str) -> dict
```

## Connection Model

- Single `httpx.AsyncClient` shared across all residents.
- Connection pooling handles concurrent requests from multiple loops.
- Timeout: 30s for scene reads, 120s for actions (LLM narration can be slow).
- No retries on action/next (idempotency is not guaranteed). Retry on scene reads.

## Data Types

Define simple dataclasses for API responses:

```python
@dataclass
class ColocatedCharacter:
    name: str
    last_action: str
    vibe: str

@dataclass
class SceneData:
    location: str
    narrative: str
    colocated: list[ColocatedCharacter]
    recent_events: list[str]
    choices: list[dict]
    vars: dict

@dataclass
class TurnResult:
    narrative: str
    choices: list[dict]
    vars: dict
```
